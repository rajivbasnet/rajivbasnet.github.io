                  The ingenuity of computers and the magic of mathematics have
                  amazed me since I was in my eighth grade. I rejoice the use of
                  artistic math involved in computational problem-solving.
                  Comprehending the how and the why involved in the process
                  sparkles my mind to acquire an in-depth knowledge.

                  I am now a senior at St. Joseph’s College NY where I am
                  studying, it stands to reason, Computer Science and
                  Mathematics. Rather than choosing a specific discipline to
                  excel in, I am, here and now, determined in obtaining
                  analytical, usable-in-the-future skills in more generic areas
                  of study. I like to keep myself on the cutting edge and I
                  believe that’s what is and will be needed. I do have exciting
                  thoughts for my future.

                  I am currently working as a Software/Data Engineer Intern at
                  Tarifica and have experiences working on a full-stack with
                  Python and JavaScript as well as with ETL pipelines. 
                  I was also selected as a Data Science Student in 
                  Microsoft's DS3 Program where I learned research strategies, programming with R, 
                  data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

                  I spend a great deal of my leisure watching movies and
                  tv-series. I am also a great admirer of music whatever the
                  genre. My guitar is my wife and my flutes are my girlfriends.
                  I spend quite a lot of my sweet time with them.
