                Hi, I am <strong>Rajiv Basnet</strong>, 
                a Software Engineer specializing in scalable data architectures, automation, and robust backend APIs. 
                I am passionate about distributed systems and infrastructure, solving complex problems to build efficient and resilient solutions.
              </p>
              <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", lineHeight: "1.8", color: "#34495e" }}>
                The ingenuity of computers and the magic of mathematics have amazed me since I was in eighth grade. 
                I rejoice in the use of artistic math involved in computational problem-solving. 
                I graduated with a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics</strong> from St. Josephâ€™s University in 2021. 
                During that time, I joined the <strong>DS3 Program at Microsoft Research NYC</strong> and later interned at <strong>Tarifica</strong>, building data systems and dashboards that sparked my passion for data-driven solutions.
              </p>
              <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", lineHeight: "1.8", color: "#34495e" }}>
                Since then, I have worked at companies like <strong>Middesk</strong> and <strong>Ribbon Health</strong>, designing large-scale data pipelines, implementing entity resolution and MDM platforms, and optimizing backend APIs for enterprise-scale operations. 
                Building on this experience, I have expanded my skills across software engineering infrastructure, exploring data, backend systems, and some frontend technologies.
              </p>
              <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", lineHeight: "1.8", color: "#34495e" }}>
                Beyond work, I enjoy <em>watching movies, traveling, and listening to music</em>.
